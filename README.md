# BCIT-Practicum-Project

This project is for the half practicum and I plan to work alone on this project.
The project’s goal is to create a malicious software that would assist players on a specific game to
make it simpler. Our software game of focus is Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS: GO), an online
first-person shooting game (FPS). The software will assist users in areas such as hand-eye
coordination and in-game knowledge. Since we are dealing with a first person shooting game, handeye
coordination is very important on the success of how you play the video-game. Aiming for the
head produces the most amount of damage and would be the quickest way of winning a duel against
an opponent. Another important aspect of this hack is having advanced knowledge about opponents
which this software will provide. In the end, this software will provide an advantage for players.

## Essential Problems
The problem this project solves is one where a player, who may have had a life altering incident
causing physical or visual impairments such as hand tremors or blindness, is having a difficult
time playing or learning how to play a video game (Refer to Appendix 16.3 for examples). CS: GO
is played online so there are no difficulty settings for the game. This project will have features
that would assist the players in learning the game and allow them to adjust the difficulty of the
game if it turns out to be too challenging. This game has been chosen due to the fact that it is an
online game with software security measures therefore being able to play online with friends is
important.

## Goals and Objectives
The project’s goal is to create a solution that will provide users with visual and physical aids when
playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive through reading and writing into the computer's
memory. These solutions are:
* Visual 
  * Extrasensory Perception
* Physical
  * Aim Assist
  * Trigger (Auto shooting
